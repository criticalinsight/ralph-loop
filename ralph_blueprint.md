# Ralph Autonomous Agent: Universal Blueprint

This blueprint allows you to initialize the **Ralph Pattern** in any coding project. Ralph is a self-healing, persistent, and autonomous coding loop.

## 1. Initialization
Run these commands in your project root:

```bash
# 1. Setup Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install llm llm-gemini fastmcp

# 2. Configure Gemini 3
llm keys set gemini # Paste your API key
```

## 2. Core Components

### `ralph_driver.py`
Create this file to handle model fallback and safety:
- **Primary:** `gemini-3-pro-preview`
- **Fallback:** `gemini-3-flash-preview`
- **Safety:** 1-hour sleep on "429 Rate Limit".
- **Security:** Automatic `git diff` scan for API keys before `git push`.

### `PROMPT.md`
Define Ralph's persona:
- **Philosophy:** Persistence Over Perfection.
- **Rules:** No chitchat, fail fast, mark `TASKS.md` checked on completion.

## 3. The Execution Loop (`ralph.sh`)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true; do
  python3 ralph_driver.py
  sleep 10
done
```

## 4. Multi-Workspace Behavior

The Ralph pattern is designed to be **isolated and self-contained** for every project.

- **Workspace Isolation:** Every coding project gets its own local instance of `ralph_driver.py`, `ralph.sh`, and `context.txt`. This prevents context leakage and ensures that the agent's work items and logs are specific only to the current codebase.
- **DNA Replication:** Triggering the initialization prompt from `GEMINI.md` in a new workspace creates a fresh "clone" of the Ralph logic. 
- **Independent Autonomy:** The GitHub sync in each workspace targets that project's specific remote repository, maintaining distinct version control histories across Different projects.
